    "##  Interpreting the results\n",
    " - Note that the greatest contribution to chi-Sq is vehicle 4.\n",
    " - Note that P-value is <0.05.\n",
    " - Vehicle 4 is the most different (and highest) percent defective.\n",
    " - Practical application: Especially focus on vehicle 4 root cause analysis and corrective action.\n",
    " - The Chi-Square or G-test is considered unreliable if the expected frequency ($E$) in any cell is less than 5.\n",
    " - The Fix: If your table fails the guideline (i.e., too many expected counts are \"too small\"), you should not use the Chi-Square or G-test. The correct alternatives are: Fisher's Exact Test (for $2 \\times 2$ tables). Exact Multinomial Test or Simulated P-values (Monte Carlo methods) for larger tables."

    "## Watchouts\n",
    " - Significantly different counts of total (defective plus non-defective) can skew the results.\n",
    " - Low expected counts (<5) can yield an alert message. If so, look to increase sample size, combine categories to avoid low expected counts, or do Fisher’s exact test.\n",
    " - Remember what contribution to chi-Sq is measuring: It is measuring the greatest contribution to chi-Sq. so sometimes the highest contribution to chi-Sq can be shared with least number of defects and greatest amount of defects."
